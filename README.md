# Recommendations

- Not so much a recommendation, but you’ll need a soldering iron to solder/desolder the audio wires. Remember which one is the left/right channel and ground (or just take a picture).
- I recommend printing the pivot with with at least an 80% infill. The other parts don’t need the strength as much, but if you want them to last longer, you should print them with at least an 80% infill as well.
- The pivot should have support blockers for the holes that intersect. Otherwise you’ll have bits of plastic that block the wire from passing through and you won’t be able to get the plastic out.
- The Band Assembly should have the groove side facing up when printing, otherwise the pivot will cause friction when you assemble the parts together.

Recommendations got you down? Don’t know how to do them? Download the .3mf file containing the recommendations which you can import it into Prusa Slicer. It should also work with Cura, but I have not tested it
