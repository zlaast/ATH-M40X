# Start
Download the .3mf files which you can import it into Prusa Slicer. Delete what you don't need. It should also work with Cura, but I haven't tested it.
If you don't want to use the .3mf files, then you can always use the individual STL files

# Recommendations on printing individual parts
- Not so much a recommendation, but you’ll need a soldering iron to solder/desolder the audio wires. Remember which one is the left/right channel and ground (or just take a picture).
- I recommend **printing the pivot with with at least an 80% infill**. The other parts don’t need the strength as much, but if you want them to last longer, you should print them with at least an 80% infill as well.
- The **pivot should have support blockers for the holes, and those blockers should intersect**. Otherwise you’ll have bits of plastic that block the wire from passing through and you won’t be able to get the plastic out.
- The Band Assembly should have the groove side facing up when printing, otherwise the pivot will cause friction when you assemble the parts together.
